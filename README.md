## Game Description
A hilarious endless runner where **Jackie Chan** dashes through our uncle‚Äôs shop, dodging cartoon villains, leaping over chaos, and flipping gravity itself! The longer you survive, the faster the madness gets. ‚ö°  

üé∂ *Bonus nostalgia*: Jackie Chan Adventures **intro music** plays in the background while you run ‚Äî hype guaranteed!  

## The Concept
You play as Jackie Chan, caught in a wacky chase inside Uncle‚Äôs shop. Villains are everywhere, blocking your way. But Jackie has two powers:  

- **Jump (Spacebar):** vault over villains and traps.  
- **Flip Gravity (F key):** run on the ceiling to outsmart enemies.  

The mission: **Survive, score high, vibe to Jackie‚Äôs theme song, and prove Jackie never loses.** üêâ  

Game ends if:  
- You hit a villain.  
- You run out of the screen (upside down or grounded).
